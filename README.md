# Second-Derivative-Method
To solve differential equation that have power more than two, you can use second derivative method. The second derivative methods in this package are Forward Difference, Backward Difference, and Center Difference is implemented in Fortran 95 program. So, make sure you have Fortran compiler in your computer already.
# The Package
There are four files in this package:
  1. SecondForwardDif.f95
  2. SecondBackwardDif.f95
  3. SecondCenterDif.f95
  4. plot_SecondDerivative.m (Matlab)
# How To Use?
The programs have same function to solve it, that is f(x) = x^3. You have to set three parameters input, for example:
  - Initial Boundary = 0
  - Final Boundary = 10
  - Data length = 100
